## Setup
1. Clone this repository and check the requirements via engines field of package.json.
2. Install dependencies using npm install in ```server``` folder and ```browser``` folder.
3. Run the server using ```cd server && npm start``` and run two clients using ```cd browser && npm start```. The second time you run the client, you will be asked to run on a different port, say yes. 
4. Now you have two clients running. Open both localhosts by visiting ```http://localhost:PORT/```. Once both are open, click on "Link devices"
